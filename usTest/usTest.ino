  HC-SR04 Ping distance sensor
  
  Distance calculated is mostly accurate
  
  VCC to arduino 5v GND to arduino GND
  Echo to Arduino pin 13 Trig to Arduino pin 12
  Red POS to Arduino pin 11
  Green POS to Arduino pin 10
  560 ohm resistor to both LED NEG and GRD power rail

   * Explanation: The approximate speed of sound in dry air is given by the formula:
   *  Approx. speed of sound in dry air, c = 331.5 + 0.6 * [Air Temp. in Deg. C]
   *  At 20Â°C, c = 331.5 + 0.6 * 20 = 343.5 m/s
   *  c = 343.5 * 100 / 1000000 = 0.03435 cm/us (in cm per us)
   *  Distance = (t/2) * c [t = total time to and fro, t/2 = one way]
   * 
   *  Can also use "Pace of Sound".
   *  Pace of Sound = 1 / Speed of Sound = 1 / 0.03435 = 29.1 us/cm
   *  Distance = (t/2) / 29.1
